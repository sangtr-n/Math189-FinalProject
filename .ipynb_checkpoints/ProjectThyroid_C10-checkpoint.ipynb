    "According to the Cleveland Clinic, thyroid gland is a part of endocrine system and located around the base of the Larynx (voice box), surrounding the trachea (windpipe) and is responsible for creating necessary hormones to regulate the body functions like metabolism through chemical reaction and control hormones by releasing the hormones into the bloodstream. In fact, all cells require energy from metabolized food in order to function so thyroid plays an important role in maintaining that our body is working properly. It is a fairly common disease as stated by Cleveland Clinic, diseases that degrade or over activate the thyroid function can have a major impact on our body functionality such as fatigue, weight loss/gain, depression, heavy or irregular menstrual periods, mood swing, etc… However, the diseases are not debilitating and are all treatable through the use of medication, therapy, or surgery.\n",

    "We are planning to do data cleaning to take out unneeded variables, missing values, one-hot encoding, and combine data in order tidying the data. In addition, we are planning to do exploratory data analysis to see how the variables might be related to each other and to the thyroid relationship. Visualization of these features is key and we are planning to use graphs such as scatter plots, ECDF, QQ-plot, correlation matrices, etc to gain a better understanding of these features. After that, we are planning to experiment with different models such as linear regression, PCA, etc... Lastly, we will interpret the results."
